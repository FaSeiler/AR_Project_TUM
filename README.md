## Description

AR Scavenger Hunt lets you compete against each other in a series of mini-games. The goal of the app is to have multiple groups playing outside at the same time in a scavenger hunt format. The first team to manage to collect all the crowns from each puzzle/game wins. There are currently five mini-games released, but more are to be added in the future.
